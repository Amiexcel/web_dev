    <h2>
    <p style="color: rgb(87, 4, 21); font-style: italic;"> Being sensitive to times and seasons <br>is one of the ways we beautify our character <br> and interactions with our fellow humans.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(107, 61, 4); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> While you're in seasons of celebration, <br> another might be in season of mourning <br> or sadness and vice versa.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(77, 6, 77); font-family: cursive;"> Sometimes we are caught up in our <br> small perfect world and we become oblivious <br> of what another might be going through, <br> hence we're more concerned with keeping records <br> of people that showed up to celebrate with us <br> and we build up an illusion that those that didn't <br> show up are "haters"</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(73, 12, 216); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Have you ever in your small world of <br> insensitive paranoia checked up on people to even know <br> why they did not rise to the occassion? <br> Do not be delusional...<br>Everybody get their own wahala</p>

    <h1 style="color: royalblue; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;"> Self Worth </h1>
    <h2>
    <p style="color: teal; font-family: unset;"> The only one who gets to decide your worth is you. <br> It doesn't come from your bank account <br> or the number of friends you have. <br> It's called seld worth for a reason <br> because it comes from you.</p>
    <p style="color: purple; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> It comes from being yourself <br> and being proud of who you are. <br> It comes from being someone that you can count on <br> and someone you love. <br> The numbers will change with time, <br> but what won't change is who you are deep inside. </p>
    <p style="color: black; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> You are beautiful, limitless, <br> wonderful, creative, strong, capable... <br>and that is where your worth comes from</p>
